## Session-End Ritual (Run Every Time)

"Summarize today's work, calculate time saved, and append a new row to METRICS_TRACKING.md. Suggest one improvement to the CLAUDE.md in this folder. For enterprise teams, also fill in the autonomy row."

**Company-wide goal:** Average 5× speedup within 2 weeks. Zero 🔴 HIGH risk sessions by Week 4.
