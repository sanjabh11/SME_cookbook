## Welcome to the 10x HR Workflow

This guide is designed specifically for Human Resources professionals to achieve a massive productivity boost (10x) using Claude Code. You do **not** need to be technical. By using natural language, you can automate repetitive tasks, draft comprehensive policies, and analyze employee data in seconds.

## 1. Setting Up Your Workspace

1. Open **Google Antigravity**.
2. Open the cookbook folder: `File → Open Folder → Cookbook-SME-Robotics`.
3. Navigate to the HR folder: `non-technical/finance-hr/`.
4. Open your Claude Code sidebar (`Cmd + L` or `Ctrl + L`).

**Important Safety Rule:** When handling protected employee data, ensure your session does not use real PII (Personally Identifiable Information) unless you are operating within a strict compliance boundary (like the Enterprise HIPAA connector). For local experiments, always anonymize your CSV files.

## 2. Core Workflows to Automate Today

Here are the 4 most time-consuming tasks you can automate immediately. Copy and paste the prompts below into the Claude Code sidebar.

### A. Candidate Screening & Interview Prep
Instead of manually reading 50 resumes, let Claude summarize them and draft tailored questions.

**Your Prompt:**
> "Read the 10 candidate bios in `candidates_batch_1.csv`. Create a summary table ranking them against our job description for 'Senior Product Manager'. Then, generate 3 custom technical interview questions for the top 3 candidates based on their specific work history."

**Time saved:** 2 hours ➔ 3 minutes.

### B. Employee Onboarding Plans
Generating 30-60-90 day plans takes hours. Build them instantly.

**Your Prompt:**
> "Generate a comprehensive 30-60-90 day onboarding plan for a new 'Operations Manager' joining the team. Include milestones, check-ins, and standard compliance training paths. Format this as a professional Markdown document that I can directly export to PDF."

**Time saved:** 3 hours ➔ 5 minutes.

### C. Policy Drafting & Harmonization
Need to update an employee handbook or draft a new remote-work policy? 

**Your Prompt:**
> "Draft a new 'Hybrid Remote Work Policy' for a 100-person company. It must include definitions of core hours (10 AM to 3 PM), a hardware stipend section, and an approval workflow for permanent relocation. Keep the tone professional but empathetic."

**Time saved:** 4 hours ➔ 10 minutes.

### D. Compensation & Quarterly Review Analysis
(If acting on anonymized/aggregated CSV data)

**Your Prompt:**
> "Analyze `Q3_performance_scores_anonymized.csv`. Give me a breakdown of the average performance scores by department. Identify any departments that are significant outliers (very high or very low). Present the findings in a clear table and a bulleted executive summary."

**Time saved:** 2 hours ➔ 5 minutes.

## 3. The 10x Mindset: Iteration & Refinement

Claude gets you 90% of the way there immediately. Your job is the final 10% of polish. The 10x productivity comes from iteration:

1. **Ask for updates, don't start over:** "Update that onboarding plan, but make the 60-day milestone focus more on cross-functional leadership."
2. **Combine tasks:** "Take that policy you just drafted, and summarize it into a 5-bullet email announcement for the all-hands Slack channel."
3. **Save your best prompts:** Keep a `MY_PROMPTS.md` document in this folder to save your most successful instructions for next quarter.

## 4. End of Week Ritual

To continuously improve, make sure you track your wins. Every Friday afternoon, ask Claude:
> "Update the `templates/METRICS_TRACKING.md` file with the workflows I ran this week. I saved roughly 8 hours on candidate screening and policy drafting."

This proves your 10x ROI to leadership and builds your portfolio as an AI Champion.
